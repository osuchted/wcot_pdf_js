PDF JavaScript Starter Examples

Examples of the use of JavaScript in PDF documents.

JavaScript can be used in PDF documents (or PDF forms) to customise the document and add features such as:

* Validation
* Calculations
* Display alerts

Not all PDF viewers support JavaScript in a PDF therefore it is best to use:

* [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/otherversions/)
* [Qoppa PDF Studio Viewer](https://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudioviewer/download/)

to ensure that JavaScript is working as expected.
